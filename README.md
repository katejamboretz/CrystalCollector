# Crystal Collector Game

In this game, four crystals show up on the page and a random number generated by the computer. Random numbers are also assigned to the crystals as hidden data attributes. When the user clicks on the crystal, the on click function adds the crystal's value to a displayed user total, and the user can intuit what each assigned value is by adding it to the sum. The goal for the user is to click each crystal the correct number of times such that the sum equals the random displayed number. If the sum equals the random number, a win is added, the sum is reset to zero and new random numbers are generated for the crystals and the displayed number. If the sum goes over the random dislayed number, the random numbers are reassigned, the sum is reset to zero and one point is added to the losses. The displayed random number is limited from 19 to 120 and the crystal value is limited to between 0 and 12 by pushing those values to an array, then a Math function is used to pick a random value from those arrays when the page is ready and when the game is reset. This was UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Coding Bootcamp homework assignment.
